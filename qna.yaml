      On 1 October 2016, while he was signing autographs at Romics, an eighteen-year-old
      boy hit Alessandrini in the eye with a Nutella croissant and fled into the crowd;
      after about half an hour he returned, managing to hit him with another croissant
      the second time. This time, however, the YouTuber's guards managed to capture the
      eighteen-year-old and brought him in front of Alessandrini. The boy began to cry
      in front of him, and so Alessandrini decided not to file a complaint with him. Two
      days later Alessandrini uploaded a video with his reactions, where he expressed all
      his disappointment towards those who use YouTube to incite gestures of that
      kind and create hatred towards him. The event was called "Nutellagate" by the
      web. On 5 October, the attacker, who owns the Zedrik HD channel, uploaded a
      video in which he claimed responsibility for the act, calling it "a joke"; he
      also said he had spoken to Alessandrini to apologize. The fact was later
      confirmed by a video uploaded to the latter's channel.

      In early November 2022, Alessandrini announced a collaboration with Durex Italia
      for the creation of limited edition condoms with a hermit crab drawn on the box,
      called "Durex Let's go".
      On 19 November 2022 Alessandrini was reported by the Guardia di Finanza for tax
      evasion for euros 400,000, meaning he would not have declared income for 1 million euros.
      According to the reconstructions, Alessandrini would have failed to
      declare to the tax authorities more than one million euros in compensation in
      the last five years. With these figures, having exceeded the minimum thresholds
      of punishment established by current legislation, once the financiers of the
      Provincial Command of Rome discovered the omission, the complaint was immediately triggered.
      During the investigations, the military reconstructed in detail the volume of
      the entrepreneur's and the company's turnover thanks to an analysis of the
      partnership contracts stipulated with the multimedia giant Google Ireland and
      with some sponsorship agencies.
      Alessandrini gave a first update on the matter via his Instagram profile, where
      he explained that he was not a tax evader and that his lawyers were already
      working on the case.
      In January 2023 he received further criticism for his political point of view
      expressed during a live broadcast, praising a one-party state.
      In March 2022, he published his second cookbook, I Burger di Ciccio. Over the
      next two years, while occasionally playing Supercell video games, he gained
      increased popularity with his cooking series In Cucina con Ciccio. This success
      led him to open several sandwich restaurants named I Burger di CiccioGamer89 in
      major Italian cities such as Rome, Bologna, Naples, and Turin. On 30 June
      2024, he also opened his first trade card shopping center in Imperia with the
      Jacopo Privitera, the leader of the Italian Pokémon Prestige Community. He also

      anticipation of the gathering.
