In his channel he mainly posts gameplay videos, but he also created a series of

his weight loss journey. He has opened multiple sandwich restaurants in Italy. 

## Early life
Alessandrini was born in Rome, Italy, to a poor family. When he 
was young he worked as a porter and baker. 

## Internet career 

### Beginning (2012–2015)
Alessandrini originally registered a YouTube account in the early 2010s,
but after reaching 1000 subscribers, YouTube closed his channel.
On 8 July 2012, he joined YouTube again under the nickname CiccioGamer89. 

In his early years as a YouTube creator, Alessandrini focused on video game 
commentaries and let's play about Minecraft and Slenderman, keeping his facial 
appearance secret. After a month, he showed his face in a video for the first 
time and revealed the reason that prompted him to choose the nickname with 
which he became famous. On 8 September 2012, he made his first vlog. During 
these first years, he increased his popularity with the two "trademarks" of his 
channel: the Hermit crab that acts as both the logo and mascot of the channel 
and his characteristic greeting at the beginning of each video, "Hakuna Matata, 
ragazzi!" (in Swahili "Without thoughts"). 

In a short time, Alessandrini became a point of reference for the Italian 
YouTube community, with his videos about FIFA, MotoGP 15, Clash Royale and his 
format In Cucina con Ciccio. The format consisted in advertising cooking 
videos. In February 2014 he reached 100.000 subscribers on YouTube and after 
ten months he reached 500.000 subscribers. 

### Golden Button and "Nutellagate" (2016)
On 2 July 2016 he received the YouTube Golden Button for 1,000,000 subscribers.
On 1 October 2016, while he was signing autographs at Romics, an eighteen-year-old
boy hit Alessandrini in the eye with a Nutella croissant and fled into the crowd;
after about half an hour he returned, managing to hit him with another croissant
the second time. This time, however, the YouTuber's guards managed to capture the
eighteen-year-old and brought him in front of Alessandrini. The boy began to crys in front of 
him, and so Alessandrini decided not to file a complaint with him. Two days 
later Alessandrini uploaded a video with his reactions, where he expressed all 
his disappointment towards those who use YouTube to incite gestures of that 
kind and create hatred towards him. The event was called "Nutellagate" by the 
web.On 5 October, the attacker, who owns the Zedrik HD channel, uploaded a 
video in which he claimed responsibility for the act, calling it "a joke"; he 
also said he had spoken to Alessandrini to apologize. The fact was later 
confirmed by a video uploaded to the latter's channel. 

### Sleeve Gastrectomy, first books and Twitch (2017–2021)
Suffering from obesity, Alessandrini underwent a bariatric surgery operation
together with his brother Simone in 2017, through the sleeve gastrectomy procedure.
In February 
2017 he published an autobiographical book Io, me e me stesso". Also in 2017, 
he was nominated in the top 3 in the Gameplay category of the Web Star Awards. 

In the same year he start doing videos about Fortnite Battle Royale and in 2018 
he published his second book CiccioGamer89 Presenta Fortnite. Trucchi e 
Segreti. 

In November 2018, Alessandrini joined the streaming platform Twitch for one 
year. 

In 2019, two years after the first operation, Alessandrini and his brother 
began another operation. In the same year he published his second book about 
Fortnite Battle Royale and eSport, and in 2020 he published his first cooking 
book. 

In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he started a fundraiser during a 
livestream, raising €2300 to be donated to the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome. In 
the next months, during another livestream in collaboration with Tom's Hardware 
and the Italian YouTubers Favij and Anima, Alessandrini raised another €17.209. 

### Legal issues and store opening (2022–present)
In early November, Alessandrini announced a collaboration with Durex Italia
for the creation of limited edition condoms with a hermit crab drawn on the box,
called "Durex Let's go". 

On 19 November 2022 Alessandrini was reported by the Guardia di Finanza for tax 
evasion for €400,000, meaning he would not have declared income for 1 million 
euros. According to the reconstructions, Alessandrini would have failed to 
declare to the tax authorities more than one million euros in compensation in 
the last five years. With these figures, having exceeded the minimum thresholds 
of punishment established by current legislation, once the financiers of the 
Provincial Command of Rome discovered the omission, the complaint was 
immediately triggered. 

During the investigations, the military reconstructed in detail the volume of 
the entrepreneur's and the company's turnover thanks to an analysis of the 
partnership contracts stipulated with the multimedia giant Google Ireland and 
with some sponsorship agencies. 

Alessandrini gave a first update on the matter via his Instagram profile, where 
he explained that he was not a tax evader and that his lawyers were already 
working on the case. 

In January 2023 he received further criticism for his political point of view 
expressed during a live broadcast, praising a one-party state. 

In March 2022, he published his second cookbook, I Burger di Ciccio. Over the 
next two years, while occasionally playing Supercell video games, he gained 
increased popularity with his cooking series In Cucina con Ciccio. This success 
led him to open several sandwich restaurants named I Burger di CiccioGamer89 in 
major Italian cities such as Rome, Bologna, Naples, and Turin.'" On 30 June 
2024, he also opened his first trade card shopping center in Imperia with the 
Jacopo Privitera, the leader of the Italian Pokémon Prestige Community. He also 
founded the society "CiccioGamer TCG (Trading Card Games)". For the occasion, 
he orchestrated an inaugural event with fans in Piazza Unità d’Italia, 
prompting the local authorities to issue an ordinance for traffic regulation in 
anticipation of the gathering. 

### Personal lifeFor six years, he was engaged with Patrycja Izabela 
Leszczyszyn. Since 2019, he has been engaged with Veronica (known on internet 
as BigLove), an English teacher.
